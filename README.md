1. The first lab involves applying contrast adjustment, noise removal, and sharpness enhancement to images.
2. This lab focuses on implementing SIFT feature extraction, matching, and image stitching using OpenCV, evaluating the robustness of SIFT under scaling, rotation, and noise, and creating a composite image from two photos.
3. This lab involves implementing and comparing the performance of KNN, Decision Tree, and SGD classifiers on the Chinese MNIST dataset using OpenCV and SciKit-Learn.
4. This lab focuses on implementing an image segmentation and analysis algorithm using intensity thresholding and binary morphological operators on the provided sample images.
